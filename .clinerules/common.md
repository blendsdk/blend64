# Building and Testing
1. Always use `yarn` instead of `npm`
2. Always make sure the project builds and tests correctly before pushing to git. Use `yarn clean && yarn build && yarn test` from the project root
3. gitcm stands for: stating all changes, creating a detailed commit
4. gitcmp stands for gitcm and then `git rebase` then if there is not conflict then `git push`
