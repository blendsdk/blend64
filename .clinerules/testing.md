# Testing Standards

## IMPORTANT

These rules are **mandatory** and must be applied **strictly and consistently** across the entire codebase.

1. Allways create maximum ammount of possible tests - sophisticated and granular tests are essential.
1. Allways create end-to-end tests where possible. source -> lexer -> parser -> and beyond.
