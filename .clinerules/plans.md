### A.I Agent instructions for creating implementation plans.

## IMPORTANT:

These rules are mandetory and must be applied strictly.

For implementation plans:
When asked to create implementation plans allways split the plan in:
3.1 logicals phases that can be implemented sequentially
3.2 for each phase, define dependencies from the previous phase.
3.3 provide detailed context and reasoning and context for each phase
3.4 define clear deliverables
3.5 IMPORTANT: Create small **granular** and managable tasks - more tasks are better than - a couple of large tasks.
3.6 IMPORTANT: tasks must have a sequence number and identified like: `Task 1.2, 1.3`
3.7 IMPORTANT: Place all the tasks in a tabular manner at the end of each plan - se we can implement one after another - allow a completion checkbox for each task
3.8 IMPORTANT: It is critical to have **granular** tests and testing for each task
IMPORTANT:
Allways re-evaluate the implementation plans before implmeneting, to be absolutely sure we did not miss anything, and/or to identify inconsistancies.
